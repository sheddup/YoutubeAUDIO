<h1>Extension development stopped years ago and I've lost access to my Mozilla account so this extension will never be updated but it will remain on addons.mozilla.org collecting negative reviews(probably)<br> 
There are plenty of youtube audio only music options now in 2021 compared to 2017 so this extension is now pointless.</h1>
